# branches

**main branch:** the version of the task with either black-white or white-black arrays in facial identities BCEF. BC are white faces and EF are black faces.

**bb-ww-mixed-arrays:** this version of the task is the same as the one above but it allows for same-race (black-black and white-white) arrays in addition to the mixed race ones.

**single-face:** version of the task with only one face. This was a binary version of the task where participants would rate the single face as "EMOTIONAL" or "NOT EMOTIONAL" rather than providing an estimate using the sliding face scale.
