This is a binary version of the amplification task. In the binary version of this task, participants must rate the 

main branch: the version of the task with either black-white or white-black arrays in facial identities BCEF. BC are white faces and EF are black faces.

bb-ww-mixed-arrays: this version of the task is the same as the one above but it allows for same-race (black-black and white-white) arrays in addition to the mixed race ones.
